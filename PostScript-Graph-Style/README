PostScript::Graph::Style version 0.02
=====================================

This module provides support for styles of lines, points, bars and other objects
drawn on a chart.  It is not expected to be used independently.  See one of
these  modules for a top-level object.

    PostScript::Graph::XY
    PostScript::Graph::Bar
    PostScript::Graph::Stock

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

In the t directory there are a couple of .pl scripts which should be part of the
test suite, but I can't figure out how to include them.  Run them from within
the t directory.  The need to be run only if PostScript::Graph::Bar is
installed, which would not normally be the case first time through.

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

    PostScript::File
