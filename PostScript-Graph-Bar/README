PostScript::Graph::Bar version 0.02
===================================

This module creates a graph from either a file or an array of points.  The graph
is written to a postscript file, either for printing directly or in EPS format
for inclusion in another file.

It would be used as follows:
    (a) Create a PostScript::Graph::Bar object using the defaults or any of over
	140 options.
    
    (b) Use the series_from_file() method to read graph data from a CSV file.
    
    (c) Call build_chart() to assemble the postscript code which draws the graph.
    
    (d) Use the output() method to save the postscript file.
