PostScript::Graph::Paper version 0.06
=====================================

This module creates a blank graph grid and writes the result into a postscript
file.  It is not expected to be used independently.  See one of these  modules
for a top-level object.

    PostScript::Graph::XY
    PostScript::Graph::Bar
    PostScript::Graph::Stock

The graph paper has labelled axes, title and a key area as well as suitably
chosen scales and grid.  Either it stands alone, creating its own
PostScript::File object, or it can add the blank chart into an already
existing one.

It would be used as follows:
    (a)	Analyse the data to be graphed, especially extracting min and max values
	for both axes.
    
    (b) Call PostScript::Graph::Paper::new() with from 0 to over 60 options.
	Hopefully this gives enough flexibility.
    
    (c)	Add the PostScript code to plot points on the graph.
    
    (d) Output it as a postscript or encapsulated postscript file for printing.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

The t directory includes *.pl files which make a couple of the *.t tests.
Sometime I might work out how to get these working under MakeMaker.  In the
meantime, call them manually if you've changed the module code and the tests
need remaking (cd to the t directory first).
