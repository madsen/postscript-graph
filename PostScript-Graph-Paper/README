PostScript/GraphPaper version 0.01
==================================

This module creates a blank graph grid and writes the result into a postscript
file.  The graph paper has labelled axes, title and a key area as well as
suitably chosen scales and grid.  Either it stands alone, creating its own
PostScript::File object, or it can add the blank chart into an already existing
one.

It would be used as follows:
    (a)	Analyse the data to be graphed, especially extracting min and max values
	for both axes.
    (b) Call PostScript::GraphPaper::new() with from 0 to over 60 options.
	Hopefully this gives enough flexibility.
    (c)	Add the PostScript code to plot points on the graph.
    (d) Output it as a postscript or encapsulated postscript file for printing.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

Ignore 'Useless use of constant in void context' messages during the test.  They
are warnings from Test.pm, not errors in your installation or this module.

The t directory includes *.pl files which make the *.t tests.  Sometime I might
work out how to get these working under MakeMaker.  In the meantime, call them
manually if you've changed the module code and the tests need remaking.
